# Learning candidates — playlist-audit

Unverified observations from individual runs. The two-stage buffer that prevents single-run noise from polluting `learnings.md`.

```
learning-candidates.md  ->  (3+ confirmations OR fixes a measured eval failure)  ->  learnings.md  ->  SKILL.md rules
       ↓ (no)
    discarded after 30 days
```

Each entry is dated. One insight per bullet. Include source (which user message / which eval). When the same candidate recurs, append `+ confirmed YYYY-MM-DD (context)` rather than duplicating.

## Maintenance

- **Sweep**: every ~30 days, drop entries older than 30 days that haven't been confirmed.
- **Promote**: 3+ confirmations → move to `learnings.md`, clear from this file.
- **Demote**: a contradiction in here → mark the `learnings.md` entry "⚠️ contradicted YYYY-MM-DD".
